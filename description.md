On September 19, 1985 Mexico City was hit with the most damaging earthquake in its history.
Yesterday -exactly 32 years later- Mexicoâ€™s capital and neighbouring areas were hit again by a large earthquake that caused significant damage.
While the scale of the destruction is still being assessed, countless people passed away and the lives of many have been disrupted.
Today, many heroes are on the streets focusing on recovery and relief.
